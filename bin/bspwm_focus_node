# Correctly focus and move window.
# 
# Tiled mode - focus or move window in given direction.
# Monocle mode - focus or move next/prev window.
# Floating window - focus next/prev window or move window by set pixels.
# 
# Limitation: because of the way BSPWM behaves, this script won't be able to
# move from a window that is not floating to a window that is floating while
# in tiled mode.
# You can however move from floating window to a non-floating
# window while in tiled mode.
